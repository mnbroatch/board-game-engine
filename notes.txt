Why is there Game under currentPlayer?
  - make hidden?
  - hard to serialize

Change playerPiece to defaultPiece, owned by player?

Draw might not spawn "Game is Over!" message

player pieces should have separate piece ids (I think they already do). Conditions,
etc. should not need to reference the player object separately

piece > player: "each" instead of pieces in player section?

A grid click might not correspond to an action. In that case, dropdown / popup

is it sufficient to replace the { type: playFrom } object with playfrom.actions?

When action payload comes in, immediately expand it ("me" becomes playerId, etc)
